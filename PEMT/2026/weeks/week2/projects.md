        -   ! the question 5 asks is this repeating process on different values I thought if the process is same no matter when function is 
        -   * question 6 it was wrong because the function was made with the intention to not mutate the input
            -   so yes mutation happened on the copy but not on input
        -   ¤ question 7 I forgot the copying part from the process
        -   ! unclear comments explaining what code does
        -   * did not return true at the end of the function
