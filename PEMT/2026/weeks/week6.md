    -   mistake count:(q6)
    -   nature of mistake
    -   q6 imprecise definition
        -    "Compute three aggregate statistics (min, max, sum) from inputs and package them into a tuple
   -    q7 too generic
        -    "gather inputs → derive multiple summaries → structure output". This is the data aggregation pattern
    -   biggest obstacle:

    -   nature of mistake
        -   p2 mistake of incorrect name for 4 objects
        -   p4 unclear defining format for stop criteria
            -   and too vague about whats being tested

    -   mistake count:(!1, q1,q2,q3
    -   nature of mistake
    -   biggest obstacle:
        -   ! logical operation flaw did not initialize smallest as 0
        -   q1 incorrect not iteration and comparison but compare current to best so far
        -   q2 incorrect its not iteration and comparsion question is about what are the chunks
            -   running minimum pattern is correct answer 
        -   q3 ⚠️ Surface-level
p2
    -    mistake count: p1,p3) total mistakes 10
    -   nature of mistake
        -   p1 mistake is my incorrect understanding of the part 1 question 
            -   it asks simplest working system I thought it asks for first object to build
        -   p3 incorrect communication between objects I said direct calls but in reality its communication is coordinator led

p1
    -   mistake count: q4,q5,q6,q7
    -   nature of mistake
        -   q4 The cycle isn't "loop repeats" — it's "examine item → update state → advance" 
        -   q5  correct answer is reduction, not comparing to smallest
        -   q6  ⚠️ Vague / implementation-focused
        -   q7  Missing one critical element: stateful accumulation.

p1
    -   mistake count:(q3, q7)
    -   nature of mistake
        -   q3 correct pattern is predicate = yes no applied to all
        -   q7 the filter is THE PATTERN and verbs are traverse, test, collect
    -   biggest obstacle: 
p2
    -    mistake count: () total mistakes 7
    -   nature of mistake
        -   part  1: Misidentified the "simplest version"
            -   . The simplest version must include the coordinator (Gym) because booking is an interaction — not a property of Member/FitnessClass alone.      Without Gym, no booking can occur.
        -   part 2 the booking is passive data class it does not have actions 
        -   part4 phases 1 should build first the independent classes the tests are also too vague and unmeasurable
        -   part4 phase 3 need to tell where do solutions to challenges live who is their authority 
            -   in this case the gym needs to verify everything before creating a booking 
        -   part 4 stop criteria is not repetition of the part 1 last section but like this 
            -    Core → Validation → Reporting
