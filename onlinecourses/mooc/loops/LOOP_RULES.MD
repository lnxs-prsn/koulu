 Recommended Adjustments (Not Abandonment)
Add These 3 Elements to Your Current Process:
1. Pattern Recognition Warm-up (5 minutes)
Before each problem, quickly ask:

"Is this sequential, converging, dividing, or transforming?"

"What's the simplest possible relationship between elements?"

"Have I seen this pattern before?"

2. Solution Time Boxing

Spend 15-20 minutes on analytical thinking

If stuck, intentionally switch to coding for 15 minutes

Then return to analysis with new insights

3. "Elegant Solution" Analysis
After solving (or seeing the solution):

Compare your approach with the elegant one

Identify the key insight you missed

Add it to your pattern library
