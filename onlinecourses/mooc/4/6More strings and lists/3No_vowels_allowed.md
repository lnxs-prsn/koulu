Please write a function named no_vowels, which takes a string argument. The function returns a new string, which should be the same as the original but with all vowels removed.

You can assume the string will contain only characters from the lowercase English alphabet a...z.

An example of expected behaviour:

my_string = "this is an example"
print(no_vowels(my_string))
Sample output
ths s n xmpl

initiate function
get astring
variable for storing new string
init a loop
find a vowel 
remove vowel



!!!!!!!! consider join() for removing the vowels instead of for loop
