In this exercise you will write a program for printing out grade statistics for a university course.

The program asks the user for results from different students on the course. These include exam points and numbers of exercises completed. The program then prints out statistics based on the results.

Exam points are integers between 0 and 20. The number of exercises completed is an integer between 0 and 100.

The program keeps asking for input until the user types in an empty line. You may assume all lines contain valid input, which means that there are two integers on each line, or the line is empty.

And example of how the data is typed in:

Sample output
Exam points and exercises completed: 15 87
Exam points and exercises completed: 10 55
Exam points and exercises completed: 11 40
Exam points and exercises completed: 4 17
Exam points and exercises completed:
Statistics:

When the user types in an empty line, the program prints out statistics. They are formulated as follows:

The exercises completed are converted into exercise points, so that completing at least 10% of the exercises grants one point, 20% grants two points, and so forth. Completing all 100 exercises grants 10 exercise points. The number of exercise points granted is an integer value, rounded down.

The grade for the course is determined based on the following table:

exam points + exercise points	grade
0–14	0 (i.e. fail)
15–17	1
18–20	2
21–23	3
24–27	4
28–30	5
There is also an exam cutoff threshold. If a student received less than 10 points from the exam, they automatically fail the course, regardless of their total number of points.

With the example input from above the program would print out the following statistics:

Sample output
Statistics:
Points average: 14.5
Pass percentage: 75.0
Grade distribution:
  5:
  4:
  3: *
  2:
  1: **
  0: *
Floating point numbers should be printed out with one decimal precision.

NB: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any specific functions, so you should not place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block. If any functionality in your program is e.g. in the main function, you should include the code calling this function normally, and not contain it in an if block like in the exercises which specify certain functions.

Hint:

The user input in this program consists of lines with two integer values:

Sample output
Exam points and exercises completed: 15 87

You have to first split the input line in two and then convert the sections into integers with the int function. Splitting the input can be achieved in the same way as in the exercise First, second and last words, but there is a simpler way as well. The string method split will chop the input up nicely. You will find more information by searching for python string split online.



LOGICAL OPERATIONS 

init loop
ask user an question
receive answer
check if the answer is 2 numeric values 
first value is 0-20 and second value is 0-100 
split the answer to separate numbers if there is space between them 
init 2 list named exam points and exercise completed
add first numbers to exam point list and second number to exercise completed list
if program receives empty string end  the loop

PATTERNS
    -   init pattern
    -   conditional  loop execution pattern
    -   split pattern
    -   accumulation pattern
    -   check and evaluate  pattern
    -   input pattern




make course statistics
init loop
init dictionary with 6 keys and empty list as values 
convert completed exercises to exercise points: completed exercise/10  convert to int
if exam point is less than 10 its automatic fail there is no need to further calculate the exercise points
sum both points
chech the range sum fits in that is the grade studen got
add to dictionary
