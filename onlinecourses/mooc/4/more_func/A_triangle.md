Please write a function named triangle, which draws a triangle of hashes, and takes one argument. The triangle should be as tall and as wide as the value of the argument.

The function should call the function line from the exercise above for the actual printing out. Copy your solution to that exercise above the code for this exercise. Please don't change anything in the line function.

Some examples:

triangle(6)
print()
triangle(3)
Sample output

Input → [Function] → Expected Output
input = int > func > print str*1.. print str*n 
task needs loop that multiplies the str as many rounds it grows 
first round str*1 
second round str * 2 
etc

ONE PROBLEM AROSE
    -   range() starts from 0 and does not count to the given int
