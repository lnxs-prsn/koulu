when I come back to this to review my learning

1. Practice Pattern Recognition
Solve similar grid/pattern problems regularly

Look for mathematical relationships (coordinates, indices)

Ask: "What determines each cell's value?"

2. Build Your Solution Toolkit
Learn common patterns: (i + j) % 2, sliding windows, etc.

Study elegant solutions after solving problems

Keep a "beautiful code" journal

3. Systematic Problem-Solving Steps:
text
1. Understand the pattern visually
2. Look for mathematical relationships 
3. Consider the simplest possible building blocks
4. Write the obvious solution first
5. Then ask: "Can this be simpler?"
4. Mindset Shifts:
Trust your intuition when it says "there must be a simpler way"

Spend 5 minutes thinking before writing any code

Solve it wrong first - then refine

Quick Exercise for This Problem:
Take 2 minutes and ask:

"If I were a chessboard, what rule determines if a square is black or white?"

"How would I explain this pattern to a 10-year-old?"

The answer you'll likely arrive at: "Add the row and column numbers - if it's even, it's one color; if odd, it's the other."
