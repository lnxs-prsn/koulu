Please write a function named add_movie(database: list, name: str, director: str, year: int, runtime: int), which adds a new movie object into a movie database.
The database is a list, and each movie object in the list is a dictionary. The dictionary should contain the following keys.

add_movie(database, "Pythons on a Plane", "Renny Pytholin", 2001, 94)
