Please write a function named count_matching_elements(my_matrix: list, element: int), which takes a two-dimensional array of integers and a single integer value as its arguments. The function then counts how many elements within the matrix match the argument value.

An example of how the function should work:

m = [[1, 2, 1], [0, 3, 4], [1, 0, 0]]
print(count_matching_elements(m, 1))
Sample output

LOGICAL OPERATIONS
    -   init func
    -   receives a list of list and a int
    -   variable to store result
    -   init loop
    -   print string
    -   init loop2
    -   iterate elements
    -   if there is match to argument provided to list
    -   increment the value of the storge variable by 1
    -   return storage variable 
-
