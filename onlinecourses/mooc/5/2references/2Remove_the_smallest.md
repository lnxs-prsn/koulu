Please write a function named remove_smallest(numbers: list), which takes a list of integers as its argument.

The functions should find and remove the smallest item in the list. You may assume there is a single smallest item in the list.

The function should not have a return value - it should directly modify the list it receives as a parameter.

An example of how the function works:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]
    remove_smallest(numbers)
    print(numbers)
Sample output
[2, 4, 6, 3, 5]



LOGICAL OPERATIONS 
    -   init func
    -   receive a list
    -   init current min var
    -   init index of current min
    -   init loop
    -   iterate list by element
    -   compare element to current min
    -   if less replace current min 
    -   replace index
    -   else continue 
    -   remove element at stored index
    -   print the list


PATTERNS
    -   init pattern
    -   iteration pattern
    -   comparison pattern
    -   mutation pattern
    -   no return pattern #cannot remember correct term
    -   output pattern

CORRECT TERMINOLOGY FOR PATTERNS 
    -   linear search pattern
    -   in place mutation pattern
    -   procedure pattern
