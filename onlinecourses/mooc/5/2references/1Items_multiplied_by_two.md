Please write a function named double_items(numbers: list), which takes a list of integers as its argument.

The function should return a new list, which contains all values from the original list doubled. The function should not change the original list.

An example of the function at work:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [2, 4, 5, 3, 11, -4]
    numbers_doubled = double_items(numbers)
    print("original:", numbers)
    print("doubled:", numbers_doubled)


Sample output
original: [2, 4, 5, 3, 11, -4]
doubled: [4, 8, 10, 6, 22, -8]


LOGICAL OPERATIONS
    -   init func
    -   receive list 
    -   do not mutate received list
    -   create new list
    -   init loop
    -   iterate over element of received list
    -   multiply elements of the list by 2
    -   store to new list results of multiplication
    -   return new list
    -   print orginal and doubled lists 
-
