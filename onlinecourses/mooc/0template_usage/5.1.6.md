Please write a function named block_correct(sudoku: list, row_no: int, column_no: int), which takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid, and two integers referring to the row and column indexes of a single square, as its arguments. Rows and columns are indexed from 0.
The function should return True or False depending on whether the 3 by 3 block to the right and down from the given indexes is filled in correctly. That is, whether the block contains each of the numbers 1 to 9 at most once.
Notice that this function does not strictly follow the rules of sudoku. In a real game of sudoku there are only 9 blocks to check, and these are located at indexes (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 6), (6, 0), (6, 3) and (6, 6). Such restrictions on indexes should not be implemented here.
REWORDING PROBLEM
    -   function takes a list and two int values
    -   the two int values are the starting point of the 3 by 3 block of numbers
    -   so with example 0,0 values
        -   in the outer loop print only 3 inners list from 0-2
        -   and in the inner loop print elements from 0-2
LOGICAL OPERATIONS
    -   init func
    -   receive list, num 1 and num 2
    -   new list to store values
    -   init loop set in  range starting from row_no to row_no+3
    -   init inner loop set range from colum_no to colum_no+3 
    -   if not 0 add to new list if not in new list
    -   else return false
    -   return true

error is the from to which is corrected in the logical operations but left below for future reflection
1. yes
   1. init inner loop set range from colum_no-1 to (colum_no-1)+3
    -   if not 0 add to new list if not in new list
    -   else return false
2. yes
   1. init inner loop set range from colum_no-1 to (colum_no-1)+3
    -   if not 0 add to new list if not in new list
    -   else return false
3. yes
   1. if not 0 add to new list if not in new list
    -   else return false
4. yes
   1. but there is dependent storage that grows based on condition so its not fully indepent a,b,c
5. yes
   1. init inner loop set range from colum_no-1 to (colum_no-1)+3
    -   if not 0 add to new list if not in new list
    -   else return false
6. yes
   1. check if values in range of 3 are valid
7. yes
   1. go range of 3 down
   2. go range of 3 right
   3. if values are valid add to list
   4. if invalid end the process
