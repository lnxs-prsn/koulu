This is the very last sudoku task. This time we will create a slightly different version of the function for adding new numbers to the grid.
The function copy_and_add(sudoku: list, row_no: int, column_no: int, number: int) takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid, two integers referring to the row and column indexes of a single square, and a single digit between 1 and 9, as its arguments. The function should return a copy of the original grid with the new digit added in the correct location. The function should not change the original grid received as a parameter.
The print_sudoku function from the previous exercise could be useful for testing, and it is used in the example below:
LOGICAL OPERATIONS
    -   copy and add func
       -   receive a list 
        -   receive an int for row 
        -   receive an int for column
        -   receive an int for sudoku cell
        -   make copy of an list use : for full copy newlist = [row[:] for row in sudoku]
           -   then new_list[0][0]= 2
1. no
2. yes  
   1. make copy of an list use : for full copy newlist = [row[:] for row in sudoku]
   2.  then new_list[0][0]= 2
3.  no
4.  no
5.  yes
   1. make copy of an list use : for full copy newlist = [row[:] for row in sudoku]
   2.  then new_list[0][0]= 2
6.  index based nested mutation
7.  yes
    1.  value a and value b and value c
    2.  alist[a][b] = c
