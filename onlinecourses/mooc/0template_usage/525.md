Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3 by 3 grid, by two players who take turns inputting noughts and crosses. If either player succeeds in placing three of their own symbols on any row, column or diagonal, they win. If neither player manages this, it is a draw.
Please write a function named play_turn(game_board: list, x: int, y: int, piece: str), which places the given symbol at the given coordinates on the board. The values of the coordinates on the board are between 0 and 2.
NB: when compared to the sudoku exercises, the arguments the function takes are the other way around here. The column x comes first, and the row y second.
LOGICAL OPERATIONS
    -   play_turn func
        -   receive list
        -   receive x int for index of inner list
        -   receive y int for index of outer list
        -   receive piece str for value of the index location
        -   validate if x and y are  above 2 or below 0 and if the char is not 'X' or 'O'  return false
        -   else
            -   init for loop 
                -   iterate over outer list
                    -   if inner list index is y
                        -   init for loop iterate inner list
                            -   if index location is x and if value in the location is ''
                                -   set value to piece
                            -   else 
                                -   return false
            -   OR      
                -   if list[y][x] == ''
                    -   list[y][x] = piece
                -   else return false
1. yes
   -   if inner list index is y
      -   init for loop iterate inner list
          -   if index location is x and if value in the location is ''
              -   set value to piece
          -   else 
              -   return false
2. yes
   -   if inner list index is y
      -   init for loop iterate inner list
          -   if index location is x and if value in the location is ''
              -   set value to piece
          -   else 
              -   return false
3. yes
   -   if inner list index is y
      -   init for loop iterate inner list
          -   if index location is x and if value in the location is ''
              -   set value to piece
          -   else 
              -   return false
4. yes
   1. its a loop
5. yes
   -   if inner list index is y
      -   init for loop iterate inner list
          -   if index location is x and if value in the location is ''
              -   set value to piece
          -   else 
              -   return false
6. yes
   1. validate if argments are valid then mutate input list conditionally
7. yes
   1. validate input
   2. if condition matches 
   3. then index based mutation
