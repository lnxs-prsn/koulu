The function should return a new list, which contains all values from the original list doubled. The function should not change the original list.
LOGICAL OPERATIONS
    -   init func
    -   receive list 
    -   do not mutate received list
    -   init new alist
    -   init loop
    -   iterate over element of received list
    -   multiply elements of the list by 2
    -   store to new alist results of multiplication
    -   return new list
    -   print orginal and doubled lists 
1. yes
    -   multiply elements of the list by 2
    -   store to new alist results of multiplication
2. yes
    -   multiply elements of the list by 2
    -   store to new alist results of multiplication
3. no
4. yes
   1. everything is independen except that values are stored to new list
   2. its a cycle/ loop over items 
5. yes
    -   multiply elements of the list by 2
    -   store to new alist results of multiplication
6. yes
   1. multiply and store to list
7. yes
   1. x*y store result
