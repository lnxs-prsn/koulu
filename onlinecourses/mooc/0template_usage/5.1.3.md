Please write a function named count_matching_elements(my_matrix: list, element: int), which takes a two-dimensional array of integers and a single integer value as its arguments. The function then counts how many elements within the matrix match the argument value.
LOGICAL OPERATIONS
    -   init func
    -   receives a list of list and a int
    -   variable to store result
    -   init loop
    -   init loop2
    -   iterate elements
    -   if there is match to argument provided to list
    -   increment the value of the storge variable by 1
    -   return storage variable 
1. yes 
   -   comparing element to given number 
   -   and accumulating the value of the storage variable by 1 repeats
2. yes comparing and accumulation happens together
3. yes there is if and then happening
4. yes the process goes a,b,c and then starts again with new info but i have saving of info
5. yes am doing same kind of thing to different items
6. compare the number to list of numbers if found accumulate counter
7. yes compare x to list of x element by element if same accumulate b value by 1

🎯 What Patterns Did You Reveal?
From your answers, you’ve identified:

- Parallel accumulation (two counters growing together)
- Categorical routing (send each item to its bucket)
- Final decision based on totals (not per-item)
- Uniform processing over a 2D grid (double loop is just traversal)
- Stateful tallying with independent inspection
