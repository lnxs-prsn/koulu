Please write a function named row_correct(sudoku: list, row_no: int), which takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid, and an integer referring to a single row, as its arguments. Rows are indexed from 0.
The function should return True or False, depending on whether the row is filled in correctly, that is, whether it contains each of the numbers 1 to 9 at most once.
REWORDING THE PROBLEM
task wants me to check if any number in one row appears more than once in a row
which means that I might need to use 3 loops to reach the end if I do naive solution
LOGICAL OPERATIONS
    -   init function
    -   receive list of lists and int
    -   set a empty list
    -   init loop 
    -   itereate throught given specific row
    -   check if element in the row is not 0 and not in the empty list 
        -   if not append element to the list else return false
    -   return true
1. yes
   1. check if element is 0 and if element is in the list
   2. check if element in the row is not 0 and not in the empty list 
2. yes
   1. check if element in the row is not 0 and not in the empty list 
      1. append 
   2. else return false
3. yes
   1. check if element in the row is not 0 and not in the empty list 
   2. then append else return false
4. yes
   1. check if element in the row is not 0 and not in the empty list 
   2. then append else return false
5. yes
   1. check if element in the row is not 0 and not in the empty list 
   2. then append else return false
6. yes
   1. check if any element appears more than once in a list
7. yes
   1. iterate a nested list
      1. append values to list if they not 0 and are not already there
      2. if they are already there end the function and return false
      3. if the loop ends after iterating all the elements 
      4. return True
