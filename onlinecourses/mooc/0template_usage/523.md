In this exercise we will complete two more functions for the sudoku project from the previous section: print_sudoku and add_number.
The function print_sudoku(sudoku: list) takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid as its argument. The function should print out the grid in the format specified in the examples below.
The function add_number(sudoku: list, row_no: int, column_no: int, number:int) takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid, two integers referring to the row and column indexes of a single square, and a single digit between 1 and 9, as its arguments. The function should add the digit to the specified location in the grid.
LOGICAL OPERATIONS
The function print_sudoku(sudoku: list) takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid as its argument. The function should print out the grid in the format specified in the examples below.
    - init function print_sudoku
    -receive a list
    -init loop
    -iterate outer list
    -interate inner list
    -every element in the inner list transform 0 to '_'
    -print every element of transformed list in specified format
        -print 3 elements space then 3 elements then space and the last 3 elements
1. yes
   1. every element in the inner list transform 0 to '_'
   2. print every element of transformed list in specified format
      1. print 3 elements space then 3 elements then space and the last 3 elements
2. yes
   1. every element in the inner list transform 0 to '_'
   2. print every element of transformed list in specified format
      1. print 3 elements space then 3 elements then space and the last 3 elements
3. yes
   1. traverse the list if element is 0 mutate to _ else continue
   2. print in specific format
4. yes
   1. its a cyclical loop
5. yes
   1. traverse the list and conditionally mutate print in specific format
6. yes
   1. traverse the list and conditionally mutate print in specific format
7. yes
   1. traverse a list
   2. conditionally mutate
   3. formatted output
The function add_number(sudoku: list, row_no: int, column_no: int, number:int) takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid, two integers referring to the row and column indexes of a single square, and a single digit between 1 and 9, as its arguments. The function should add the digit to the specified location in the grid.
    - init function add_number
    - receive the list
    - receive the row_no, col_no and the number 
    - direct assignment
    - if row_no, col_no more than -1 and less than 9 and the number is more than 0 and less than 10 else return error message
        - take first number as index of outer 
        - take second number as index for inner list
        - set third number as value for the index location
1. no
2. yes
   1. take first number as index of outer
   2. take second number as index for inner list
   3. set third number as value for the index location
3. yes
   1. if row_no, col_no and the number are more than -1 and less than 10 else return error message
4. no 
   1. no loop or cycle just direct assigment 
5. no
   1. function is one time run
6. yes
   1. index based mutation
7. yes
   1. index based mutation
   2. list[index][index] = new  value
