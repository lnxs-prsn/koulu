Please write a function named remove_smallest(numbers: list), which takes a list of integers as its argument.
The functions should find and remove the smallest item in the list. You may assume there is a single smallest item in the list.
The function should not have a return value - it should directly modify the list it receives as a parameter.
LOGICAL OPERATIONS
    -   init func
    -   receive a list
    -   init current min var
    -   init loop
    -   iterate list by element
    -   compare element to current min
    -   if less replace current min
    -   else continue
    -   remove element
    -   print the list
1. yes
   1. compare element to current min
    -   if less replace current min
    -   else continue
2. yes
   1. compare element to current min
    -   if less replace current min
    -   else continue
3. yes
    -   compare element to current min
    -   if less replace current min
    -   else continue
4. yes
   1. there is a loop
5. yes 
6. yes
   1. compare if less replace
7. yes
   1. compare if smallest remove
