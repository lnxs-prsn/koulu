 Phase 1: CHUNK IT
- Understand the problem (what are we building?)
- Break into pieces (what are the smallest learnable parts?)



 Phase 2: DESIGN & STRUGGLE
- Design solution (how will it work?)
- Find mistakes early (what could go wrong?)
- Correct mentally (fix the design before coding)

 Phase 3: LEARN FROM OTHERS
- Research 15 min: Find 2-3 examples online
- Note patterns: What do good developers do?
- Avoid anti-patterns: What do bad examples do?

 Phase 4: IMPLEMENT
- Code with focus
- Embrace errors (they're learning moments)
- Fix and repeat (build better neural pathways)

That's it. Four clean phases. No complexity.
