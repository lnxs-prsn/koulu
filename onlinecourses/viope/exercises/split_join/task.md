In this exercise create two functions

my_split : which splits sentence given as first argument using second argument as a separator character to separate list items. Function returns a list of items.
my_join : which joins list given as first argument to a string separated with character given as second argument. Function returns a string.
In this exercise you are not allowed to use Python split and join functions

Example output:
Please enter sentence:This is a sentence
This,is,a,sentence
This
is
a
sentence
The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)

function1 (text, character/symbol)
    alist = text.split(chracter/symbol)
    return alist

function2(alist, charcter/symbol)
    string = character/symbol.join(alist)
    return string
