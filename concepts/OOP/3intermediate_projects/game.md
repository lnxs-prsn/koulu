### **Exercise 1: Simple Game Objects**
# Game → Player? (Game manages players)
# Player → Game? (Player knows which game they're in)
# Player → Card? (Player holds cards)
# Card → Player? (Card knows who holds it?)

# Python implementation level questions:
# 1. Should Game create Player objects, or are they created separately?
# 2. When Player plays a Card, who updates the game state?
# 3. If Player quits, what happens to their Cards?
