1. Library Circulation System
Build a system that tracks which books are checked out to which members, enforces borrowing limits, and prevents invalid operations (like checking out an unavailable book). Use no more than three classes.

2. Minimal Social Feed
Model a feed where users can post messages and interact with others’ posts (e.g., liking). Ensure actions produce consistent state changes across the system. Limit your design to three classes.

3. Banking Transaction Simulator
Simulate accounts that support deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, while maintaining a permanent, immutable log of all transactions. Design it using at most three classes, with strong invariants (e.g., no negative balances).
