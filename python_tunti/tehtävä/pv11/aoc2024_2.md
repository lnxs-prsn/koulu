    7 6 4 2 1: Safe because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.
    1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe because 2 7 is an increase of 5.
    9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe because 6 2 is a decrease of 4.
    1 3 2 4 5: Unsafe because 1 3 is increasing but 3 2 is decreasing.
    8 6 4 4 1: Unsafe because 4 4 is neither an increase or a decrease.
    1 3 6 7 9: Safe because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.

pattern:
    go through an line of numbers 
    I find first number of the line I do nothing 
    then I find the next number in the line 
    compare it to previous number if the difference to previous number is 
    more than 1,2,3 then its ok 
    else proceed to next line 





solution
- I dont know exact size of line so I need likely an while loop
- what I need to do 
    - be able to access every number at will or store it so I can access it at will
    - take first number compare it to second number if difference is less than 3 
    - take second number and compare to third 
    - continue doing this until end of the line at the end of line add one to total_ok
    - if numbers compared difference is more than 3 exit the loop 
    - take next line do the comparison again 
    -
