    -   count starts today it would be also good to get muslim calendar date up just for reference
    -   would be recommended to shift from python improvement towars getting training place. 
        -   going to places where I can talk with people who can hire me are etc
        -   also it would be good to start doing portfolio projects that I can showcase or start doing projects like advent of code etc.
    -   next is the procedural template 
        -   2 tasks done 2 mistakes
    -   next is OOP principles

        -   I now have means to design an objects that are compliant to OOP principles 
            -   really need to do lot more repetition but main structure is in place

    -   began yesterday advent of code 2015 first task was lot easier than I expected 
        -   I will make for it different repo I will keep doing them cos the mooc starts to get bit too easy even if I use the template
    -   next is procedural thinking mooc tasks
        -   did 2 task they had few mistakes 
            -   learning important lesson how I should try to make my solution algorithm generally usable instead of solving 
                -    just this specific task
   -    this is all I have achieved today next am going to relax with aoc

3.1/26003   60min
    -   viope project 1.8 full payrollsystem
        -   made the classes and set the relationships and as am doing this for fun I did not use the templates and this led to more wasted time 
        -   back tracking which makes me grateful for the templates

4.1/26004 60min
    -   viope project 1.8 full payrollsystem
        -   proceeded to read_write_system having bit of challenge how should I implement it ?
            -   make it class or make it functions ? 
                -   class would be more compact 
                -   functions would be easier and I might be able to try it with recursion.

            -   the quiz template is in the procedural_thinking directory
    -   next is the OOP principles 
        -   due to current situation will focus on quiz setup 
            -   that is todays success target
            -   I have reached todays success target

    -   still sick but not as much as yesterday 
        -   cannot really focus for an long time at the moment so I will just try my best 
            -   no sense of failure needed as even being here now counts as success
    -   starting with the mooc but if state deteriorates then I shift to quiz as in there I really dont have to focus 
        -   did 2 mooc tasks using the pattern template
    -   next OOP task using the template
        -   might not be able to actually do it if not then I will do the quiz on OOP principles
        -   part 2 not ready

    -   got worse cos yesterday had to go do groceries.
        -   so today I feel not well at all but have to do atleast a little 
            -   todays goals is one task each and then I can shift to quiz if I run out of focus
    -   next is procedural template 
        -   did one task and proceeded to quiz 
            -   the quiz needs lots of repetitions to learn the terminology
            -   and connect pattern with tasks description
    -   next is OOP principles template
        -   insight from previous day
            -   OOP principles resemble double book keeping
            -   the part 4 is not finished 
            -   tomorrow might not be possible to do the project
