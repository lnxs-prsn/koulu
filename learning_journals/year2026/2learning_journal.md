weekend
    -  did the homework from the school
    -  it was quite fun when I understood that there is elegant way to do it
    -  I need to get the school projects back to this folder I have been confused how to organize that has
       -  to current situation

8.2/26039   60min
PEMT
    -  PEMT is done 
       -  from now on the procedural thinking templates and the OOP template wont be priority
          -  but they are expected to become normal tools to projects from now on

    -  new PEMT
       -  goal was to do project now there came opportunity to apply for an summer job as
       -   an data engineer so project of the week will be something related to it


9.2/26040
school
    -   finished the fastapi and began the flask
        -   flask would need me to have js or some js library understanding 
        -   I got this feeling after using it
home
    -   began the data pipeline project
        -   chose weather app according to suggestions of the AI 
            -   problem is most of the data is in xml format it took me quite to grasp what it is and how to deal with it xpath is the best
            -   I got 2 point data from the fmi and turned it to pandas dframe
10.2/26041
school
    -   today was finally the django day
        -   I understood a lot so for me it was listening and learning to read the django documentation better
home
    -   while on the break I found out about geojson and got illusion that my struggle with xml was over
    -   nope there implementation of the geojson is none existent in the fmi so the xml pain continued 
    -   I tried 
        -   owslib
            -   it seems to have standardized way to deal with the wfs api structures 
                -   problem either fmi uses unique keywords or I have not really understood how to use it 
            -   I finally shifter back to requests library as its better with my time constraints
        -   xmltodic
            -   I tried to deal with the pain of finding the data from the xml with xmltodict
            -   but its very useful for shallow data for deep data its just too verbose to get to values
        -   lxml
            -   thus I went back to my original finding I learned a lot but wasted time 
            -   best about AI is that it helps you find the best solution first but as one has created intuition to 
            -   doubt my first good find I ended up wasting time searching better.
    -   now I know what tools to use and have some idea how to use them 
        -   next I need to get complex data out of the fmi api
    -   painful realizations is that my project is not really much of a use in current world as there is nonexistent amount of organizations still using 
        -   xml json has become dominant in the world so I am already enjoying the task so I wont stop it but for the future its good 
        -   to analyze the value of the project am investing my time to.

12.2/26043

16.2/26047
school
    -   today was second robot day NAO V6 was cooler than the lego
    -   but as there was only robot for 8 people I really did not get to try many things I wanted
        -   one flaw in my thinking is that I get stuck trying to solve irrelevant problems or I try something that I cannot verify easily the execution
        -   feasibility
