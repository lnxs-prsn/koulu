2026-001 this is new date system
    -   year 2026 - days 001
    -   this enables me to do easier planning and deadlines are easiers to grasp.
    -   short hand is 26001 or just 001
    -   this enables easier adaption as its comperable to current system

school day
    -   API day
        -   I am dissatisfied with my learning today 
            -   I was too arrogantly assuming I knew what was going on but I didnt
                -   I need to learn seriously constantly irregardless if I think I know or not
                -   might change my sitting place to improve my learning 
home 
    -   p1 not ready
    -   p2  done

4.2/26035
day off
    -   went to startups and asked if I could do my training period in there 
        -   next stage I will send them my information
home
    -   p1 done
        -   also improved the template so from now on it will guide me to find real patterns
    -   p2  not ready

    -   p1  done
    -   p2  done   ( its lot better)

6.2/26037
school day
    -   today wrapped up the api and began fastapi
        -   there is home work for the api section so today I will focus on it
home
    -   home work api task
        -   did not finish it more tomorrow


7.2/26038   60min
weekend
    -  did the homework from the school
    -  it was quite fun when I understood that there is elegant way to do it
    -  I need to get the school projects back to this folder I have been confused how to organize that has
       -  to current situation

8.2/26039   60min
PEMT
    -  PEMT is done 
       -  from now on the procedural thinking templates and the OOP template wont be priority
          -  but they are expected to become normal tools to projects from now on

    -  new PEMT
       -  goal was to do project now there came opportunity to apply for an summer job as
       -   an data engineer so project of the week will be something related to it


9.2/26040
school
    -   finished the fastapi and began the flask
        -   flask would need me to have js or some js library understanding 
        -   I got this feeling after using it
home
    -   began the data pipeline project
        -   chose weather app according to suggestions of the AI 
            -   problem is most of the data is in xml format it took me quite to grasp what it is and how to deal with it xpath is the best
            -   I got 2 point data from the fmi and turned it to pandas dframe
10.2/26041
school
    -   today was finally the django day
        -   I understood a lot so for me it was listening and learning to read the django documentation better
home
    -   while on the break I found out about geojson and got illusion that my struggle with xml was over
    -   nope there implementation of the geojson is none existent in the fmi so the xml pain continued 
    -   I tried 
        -   owslib
            -   it seems to have standardized way to deal with the wfs api structures 
                -   problem either fmi uses unique keywords or I have not really understood how to use it 
            -   I finally shifter back to requests library as its better with my time constraints
        -   xmltodic
            -   I tried to deal with the pain of finding the data from the xml with xmltodict
            -   but its very useful for shallow data for deep data its just too verbose to get to values
        -   lxml
            -   thus I went back to my original finding I learned a lot but wasted time 
            -   best about AI is that it helps you find the best solution first but as one has created intuition to 
            -   doubt my first good find I ended up wasting time searching better.
    -   now I know what tools to use and have some idea how to use them 
        -   next I need to get complex data out of the fmi api
    -   painful realizations is that my project is not really much of a use in current world as there is nonexistent amount of organizations still using 
        -   xml json has become dominant in the world so I am already enjoying the task so I wont stop it but for the future its good 
        -   to analyze the value of the project am investing my time to.

11.2/26042
etäpv
    -   originally intended this day to be a day for training place searching but I really need project to showcase my current knowledge
    -   todays goal for the project get all possible data from the fmi to pandas data frame if possible figure out how 
    -   pydantic works 

12.2/26043
school
    -   last django day it was pleasant cemented what I new and verified some questions that I had 
home
    -   now I have pipeline to get data from fmi and clean it with pandas also got docker running 
    -   next I will try to get data from pandas to postgres 
        -   and use pandas that no duplicates exits

13.2/26044
school 
    -   robot day
        -   it was as cool as I expected but there was not enough for me to play with them so I could understand 
home 
    -   the postgress section of the project is left


14.2/26045 60 min
    -   continued the data engineering project
    -   progressing more smoothly now that plan is being followed
    -   book reading for is also finished

15.2/26046/ 60 min
PEMT    
    -   finished this weeks pemt
        -   dod and the ps are challenging to define but as this is first project its likely something I will figure out later

16.2/26047
school
    -   today was second robot day NAO V6 was cooler than the lego
    -   but as there was only robot for 8 people I really did not get to try many things I wanted
        -   one flaw in my thinking is that I get stuck trying to solve irrelevant problems or I try something that I cannot verify easily the execution
        -   feasibility
home
    -   continued the project to showcase my data engineering knowledge

17.2/26048
school
    -   today was the networking and sockets 
    -   I have now more coherent puzzle in context of computer science
    -   I had an hunch about the ip,tcp and udp now I have better grasp about them
home 
    -   project to showcase my data engineering knowledge is up in the github
    -   https://github.com/lnxs-prsn/data_engineering_001/
    -   still has lot to do but I think I will leave this as 001 now and come back later to make it more 
        -   robust

18.2/26049
school
    -   we continued with the networking
    -   we went deeper in the ipv4 and ipv6 
        -   I think I will make my own projects solely for the ipv6 I get feeling its better to do that 
    -   its not fully yet clear for me how network routing exactly works ( I obviously understand it conceptually but there is still feeling of not understanding issue is this I could explain it but not with my own words I can only parrot when explaining it)
    -   
    -   after the lunch we reached the python socket library
    -   I made it work with jupyter I have no idea how I made it
home
    -   The mvp of the data engineering project is ready and I applied for summer job I really enjoyed working on it
        -   it reminded me about years 2022 -2023 when I had datacamp subscription
    -   I asked feedback from classmate and he luckily had time and I got better insights on the project than I could have hoped for on my own 
    -   luckily I asked wasnt sure if he had time as we are all searching for an training place to intern at


19.2/26050
school
    -   worked only on python sockets today for some reason my jupyter usage for sockets refused to work which made me waste bit of time 
    -   luckily seatmates got me back to my senses and I began using the cli for the socket project
    -   we made small server and used threads to enable it to accept more than one connection apparently this is how we can make live chat
    -   I am exited about what else I can do with it 
home 
    -   continued with the small weather pipeline its very simplfied but I intend it to be the 001 of the data engineering projects 
        -   made improvements according to classmates suggestions and commented better it looks lot better.

20.2/26051
selfstudy
    -   went out to search for training place I was not really healthy for that task and top of it I was fasting so result was bit dissapointing 
    -   I got one place where I can send cv (for some reasong feeling insecure about it but its to be expected confidence is built by results)
    -   I have problem with my bank which I expected to resolve in 20 min but for some reason it took lot longer
    -   I was really not coherent for the day aroung 15 I came home and just fell sleep
    -   later in the evening worked on the data engineering project I came idea about testing I learned basic of it when I was learning how to use pythons web3 library and the solidity 

21.2/26052  60min
    -   got the basics of the test and realized that to do actual tests I need to modularize a lot more so my functions exist for one testable purpose 
        -   for example the clean_data() does 2 things it parses and it cleans data and puts it to pandas dataframe (might actually be 3 things)
        -   so if I want to test parsing there is no way for me to test it because my current rigid and hard coded project will return error if in put data does not match the expected data to the dot.
    -   still bit under the weather
