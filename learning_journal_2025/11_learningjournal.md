JOURNAL NOVEMBER

1.11/ 60 min
    - got distracted by waqaf
      - excited by the idea.
    - back to programming 
    - organized the project management 
    - pushed to github

2.11/ 60 min
    - feeling bit incoreherent 
    - not sure how to proceed
      - should I apply the playbook for deep practice playbook
        - deep practice 
    - am doing the payrollsystem from metropolia

3.11/ dayly schedule
    - had problem with grid problem 
      - knew intuitively that my solution was inefficient
        - reason I could not find better solution is because I have not met grid problems before

4.11/ dayly schedule
    - went to tech event in today very exciting but also tiring mind is still processing things I learned.
    - next figuring out if I can learn some how grid or other patterns 
      - probably same approach as learning chess patterns get them in conseptually and it will get easier 
      - learn to observe my internal solution pattern
        - Task 7: Running Total
          - Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Output: [1, 3, 6, 10]
          - Ask: "How does each element relate to previous ones?"
      - I think this 
        - 1 +2
        - 2+4 
        - the issue is no thought is full they are fragmented
        - starts stops in flash of moment realises that solution wont work and stops without going to the point where right solution could be found
    - focus on learning patterns and figuring out how they grow to algorithms 

5.11/ 20 min
  - very distracted 
  - ohjelmoinin ytimessä on tietojen käsittely 
    - saadaan tietoa muodossa x ja se pitää muuntaa toiseen muotoon.
    - kannattaa tutkia ongelmia pienin askelin
    - selvitä mikä on lähtö tilanne
    - mikä on tilanne nyt
    - mikä on loppu tilanne
  - ongelman ratkaisu 
    - yksinkertaista
      - jos listalla on kymmenen asiaa
        - tee listasta lyhempi nyt siellä on vain 1 tai 2 asiaa
  - ask this question 
    - what do I know that can solve this ?
      - aoc 2015day2
        - I tried to use while and for loop to these '20x3x11', 5x26x8,
        - but split() does it faster and easier
        - 
6.11/ python tunti
  - mostly doing the course work 
    - reason is because I have problem of organizing my files
    - unable to make the mooc work as I want it to

7.11/ python tunti
  - tunnilla list comprehension
  - set up works 
  - github working 
  - from now on will shift to uv-astral
  - still very impatient and arrogant 
    - when in task it was necessary to find way around function that did return None but 
    - printed value I arrogantly assumed that I know all and solution was simple looping
    - HOME
    - next is tmc
      - I made the line task too well and now I really dont need to do almost anything to pass the tasks.
      - enjoyed learning 

8.11/ home 60 min
  - finally back at payrollsystem task
    - honestly I can solve it but am investing in my future by learning to do it systematically
  - good progress 

9.11/ home 60 min
  - have an problem with the code my understanding of the class structure is lacking

10.11/ etä
  - tänään oli työelämässä oppiminen tunti 
    - Sain paljon uutta ajateltavaa ja selkeytin itselleni mihin hakeudun 
      - minulle myös selvisi lyhyen tähtäimen kiinnostuksen kohteet
    - sain myös tehtävän tehtyä
  - am unable to figure out this
    - number starts from 1 goes to 3 then  5 and keeps growing 2
  - solved it 
  - x+x+1


11.11/ 
  - did not do the journal in the home

12.11/ atea päivä
  - kerkesin ohjelmoimaan vähän ja ratkaisin aoc tehtävän
  - ja huomasin että tarvitsen problem managment systemin se ei ole sama kuin problem solving managment
    - se auttaisi minua jotta tunnistaisin ongelmat nopeamming enkä jäisi oman ajattelun loopiin

13.11/ linux tunti 1
  - now I can say 'btw I use arch linux'
  - its lot more fun than ubuntu as an idea I might take the plan of playing with nixos from the thought to action sooner
  - worked on mooc


14.11/ linux tunti2
  - linux2 tunti 
    - learned about importance of taking snapshots when it comes to linux
    - most of it is similar to ubuntu just few feature difference
  - tools 
    - ventoy
  - home 
    - kept doing mooc


15.11/ 60 min
    - bit distracted
    - the viope task if bit frustrating 
      - it allows the usage of replace function
      - but denies usage of split and join
      - but I can get whole task done with just replace and str index method
      - but doing so would go against my purpose of learining 
    - over all exiciting task makes you appreciate how easy standard library makes python devs life



16.11/ 60 min
  - solved the viope task from yesterday
    - I have problem of not understanding instructions in detail but in general I know what task want me to do but I dont seem to understand how it wants me to do.
    - I need to improve on this 
  - my solution is so simple that I am wondering if its acceptable
  - 

17.11/ 
koulu
  - learning about html and css 
    - taking deeper dive on css as default html is understood
home
  - merged branches
  - been doing mooc there is bit confusing task in the section 4


18.11/ 
koulu 
  - CV:n tekemistä
  - lähetin työharjoittelu hakemuksen
  - koulun koneella ei ollut vscode:ta
home
  - I have now suddenly have problem misinterpretation of the mooc exercises 
  - I usually I make small but challenging to locate typos in general


19.11/ etä
  - challenge of the day
    - but I do not understand with tenth look what is the pattern in the 
  - I can solve simple problems fast but anything that needs pattern recognition takes effort 
    - I am accumulating knowledge soon it will reach critical mass and I will start seeing patterns everywhere
    - persistence and effort pays dividence long term
  - mostly task went fluently soon done with the 4 chapter of the mooc
  - one issue that even AI mentions is that I push complexity and efficiency in the stage where its not yet necessary 
    - when looking for the patterns simplicity matters most today I have specially struggled with this aspect


20.11/ etä
  - learned today about python data type called complex
  - getting better and better grasp about how to recognize patterns
    - but before patterns I need to understand something called 
      - logical operations that make up the pattern
      - simply but even child might be able to find logical operation or two without effort 
        - intializing a tracking variable is is logical operation 
        - then arises what to track and how to track etc.
      - after I learn to find logical operations I stack them and am able to find patterns 
      - then from patterns its possible to my assumption figure out algorithms 



21.11/ olio-ohjelmointi 
koulu
  - hopefully I get missing piece of the puzzle 
home
  - it was nice to be on this course things that were challenging few weeks ago 
  - are now easier and solved lot faster 


22-23/ weekend
  - did viope and began vimtutor
  - also added 2 more extra hours for programming 
  - its generally intended for python but anything related to programming is ok
  - books are progressing well my understanding is growing very slowly when it comes to programming 
    - but what ever I understand so far I have wholesome understanding most challenge is how 
    - things connect to each other but people say repetition will solve that part.



24.11/ 
olio-ohjelmointi2
  - making an branch to later merge it
  - figure out how to make it so that every language has their own formatter on paste
  - I lack certain thinking models 
  - the tasks needed mathematical understanding to understand the question but question itself was simple 
    - after encrypting it.
home
  - merged the branch
  - did mooc


25.11/ 
olio-ohjelmointi3
  - reviewing the yesterday
  - START
    - reading PEP informative section
    - https://peps.python.org/#other-informational-peps
home
  - proceeding with mooc
  - merged the school branch
  - git the moocs logical operations and patterns 
    - slowly improving on this one some tasks I feel like I got it until next task am lost fully

26.11/ !!!etä
  - 5Neighbours_in_a_list
    - I HAD SOME CLITCH I SOLVED DIFFERENT TASK THAN I WAS ASSIGNED
      - luckily fix is easy
    - I learned something new alhamdulillaah I persisted on the simple problem
      - after checking every step of the situation 
        - task instructions, logical operations and patterns 
        - I found out that I  made an common mistake in general but to me an new revelation
          - I confused the initiation of 
            - sequence length counting and relationship counting
            - issue is this relationships start from 0 up 
              - example initially there is no relationship so status is 0
            - and sequences start from 1 up 
              - example if row call starts from you then you are #1
  - learned a lot while doing last task of the day grade statistics
    - now I can made coherently design decision 
      - without feeling overhelmed by solution options.
      - also I can make one decision at a time and build program 
      - chronologically instead of chaos process with coherent outcome




27.11/ etä
    - from now on the exection process will be simplified so 
    - I can learn most from the process
      - reason is that execution will vary throught the career but process reaching it will be constant most of the time
      - so its better to invest time on quality constant than varying outcome
      - this means naive solution is good enough 
  - mooc 4 is done 
  - FINALLY GOT TO USE THE REWORDING TEMPLATE
    - it made confusion go away in an second


28.11/

  - ask AI about these 
    - Iterative approach: Avoid recursion and repeated list creation.
      - explain this 
    - Count-based simulation: Instead of storing every stone, store counts of each value and update
      - them per blink.
    - This reduces memory from billions of integers to a dictionary of counts.
      - explain this too 
  - the class was fun today.
    - it was exciting to see my slow but easy to problem dissection plan in motion 
    - I probably reached the solution last but I actually understood myself instead of just grinding blindly to frustration
    - it feels good after long struggle to understand python.


29.11/ 60min
  - read the algorithm book 
    - am problematic reader when it comes to information book
      - constantly am checking if the information is as claimed wasted half hour checking how valid is 
        - log n! problem 
          - ignorant speculation is solution is not per se an algorithm but mix of algorithms 
  - 40 min wasted checking zagg website empty legend key board 
  - bit distracted at the moment 
  - finished the mooc from yesterday 
  - next is viope 
    - might give myself an extra time for later 


30.11/ 60min
  - still bit distracted 
  - continued the viope
    - had to fix the code to make it more simple 
    - issue  I have is that I dont know how to make the output similar to expected output 

1.12/ 
olio5pv
  - learned about dataclasses
    - they make class making faster
    - but its rigid
home
  - the book I thought of reading might not be best for this course as 
    - the examples are in c++ and am learning python 
    - what book teaches is what I need but wrapping my head over different language to 
    - learn programming problem solving processes might not be worth it
  - next homework
    - did most of the task
    - am not sure if I understood the task correctly 
  - OVER ALL
    - I have began slipping on the discipline 
      - might need drill week to train the basics of self conduct


2.12/ home
  - finished the school task 
    - not sure if I did it correctly as I have never done this before
  - next is mooc
    - bit distracted 
      - I have said this few times now 
        - RETURN TO ADDRESS LATER
  - section of mooc done 1/4
    - most looks very easy but I will use time learning 'THINK BEFORE YOU CODE' 
      - I have found that programming is more enjoyable and faster when I think ahead
        - what are the requirements of the task 
        - what does it limit me from doing 
        - how much over engineering will I permit for myself
        - what architectural decision need to be made now so I avoid endless fix as you proceed 
          - then return to change something as something did not work out as intended
        - this allows me to see myself and my lackings better

3.12/ 
etä
  - today was ohjaus 
    - I fixed my misunderstandings so far 
    - rest of the day I have been doing mooc
      - now on I will focus on the design pattern recognition 
        - I found out that the coding part no matter how complex it might appear 
        - after the design phase takes max 15 min 
        - I have already by then made the design decision and am in flow mode 
        - so am more productive 


4.12/
oliopv6
  - great day after a while I was quite out of my comfort zone
    - I generally knew how I could do it as I imagined
      - but I could not grasp at all how the teacher intended to do 
      - and I still dont understand  
        - I will use AI to go through the game to understand what was the problem for me not understanding 
home 
  - It was an great moment I have finally reached step where I can get rid of my confusion about OOP 
  - got multiple exercises with AI and figured out why I succeed so well with functions but fail so miserably with objects 
    - I do not know arrow direction of the dependencies because the OOP logic is nigh opposite to real life arrows of depedencies between objects 

5.12/ self study day
  - got myself drills to cement my understanding about arrow direction patterns with OOP 
    - really enjoying today it feels great to get rid of ignorance.
    - will pull the exercises through the problem journal and store to new folder of concepts 
    - It seems bit more challenging than I thought to figure out the OOP design but I feel that I grasp more every time I try
  - passed on going to bitcoin event am feeling that by the end of the day I will have better understanding of the python if I keep at it
  - I am understanding the arrow flow of the objects relationships

6.12/ 60 min
  - the viope task was very easy I just misunderstood the exercise
  - dont know which day it is since I began 
  - am still curious and learning more 
    - my present challenges appear to be mostly reading comprehension as that appears to be my biggest time waste
      - I have succeeded cutting it down by adding 'did I understand it correctly' at the beginning of every task I start
    - other challenges are emptiness of my conceptual library 
      - OOP concepts are easy to comprehend but challenging to apply to this issue 
        -  or at least I assume this is the case.

7.12/ 60min
  - began bit slow the viope project
    - its simple but I might get suprises later on.
  - the book is good first 5 min helped me to coordinate my effort better in learning

8.12/ 
iopv
  - will continue with the OOP 
    - I dont intuitively yet understand relationships objects have 
      - meaning I do not understand the priciple of object building 
        - which is coordinator object in cluster of object 
        - which is data object
  - went well drilled further my understanding  about 
    - OOP concepts 
    - knocked on the door of system design with the help of AI
  - progressed quite well
    - had to stop myself going too deep to system design 
      - my current scope is just learn OOP design principles and its logical flow of process
        - which is central node etc
  - day went pleasanty forgot few times to take break but else all good 
    - at somepoint had to take power nap as I had cooked the brains too much
  - 7 domain modeling templates I made now ensure almost 100% success when figuring out how data and authority flows in object programming
    - without them I default to my incorrect assumptions and reach 50% success rate
  - good day I yet have not programmed single line of code
    - I have focused on improving my conseptual undestanding 


9.12/
iopv
  - proceeded to design decisions of the OOP
    - I now understand better how I should have proceeded with the battleship game
      - also I understand better how relationships of he objects works who is in charge and who is merely participant
      - I might be over evaluating myself but I feel like I could now do jr dev tasks.
