JOURNAL NOVEMBER

1.11/ 60 min
    - got distracted by waqaf
      - excited by the idea.
    - back to programming 
    - organized the project management 
    - pushed to github

2.11/ 60 min
    - feeling bit incoreherent 
    - not sure how to proceed
      - should I apply the playbook for deep practice playbook
        - deep practice 
    - am doing the payrollsystem from metropolia

3.11/ dayly schedule
    - had problem with grid problem 
      - knew intuitively that my solution was inefficient
        - reason I could not find better solution is because I have not met grid problems before

4.11/ dayly schedule
    - went to tech event in today very exciting but also tiring mind is still processing things I learned.
    - next figuring out if I can learn some how grid or other patterns 
      - probably same approach as learning chess patterns get them in conseptually and it will get easier 
      - learn to observe my internal solution pattern
        - Task 7: Running Total
          - Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Output: [1, 3, 6, 10]
          - Ask: "How does each element relate to previous ones?"
      - I think this 
        - 1 +2
        - 2+4 
        - the issue is no thought is full they are fragmented
        - starts stops in flash of moment realises that solution wont work and stops without going to the point where right solution could be found
    - focus on learning patterns and figuring out how they grow to algorithms 

5.11/ 20 min
  - very distracted 
  - ohjelmoinin ytimessä on tietojen käsittely 
    - saadaan tietoa muodossa x ja se pitää muuntaa toiseen muotoon.
    - kannattaa tutkia ongelmia pienin askelin
    - selvitä mikä on lähtö tilanne
    - mikä on tilanne nyt
    - mikä on loppu tilanne
  - ongelman ratkaisu 
    - yksinkertaista
      - jos listalla on kymmenen asiaa
        - tee listasta lyhempi nyt siellä on vain 1 tai 2 asiaa
  - ask this question 
    - what do I know that can solve this ?
      - aoc 2015day2
        - I tried to use while and for loop to these '20x3x11', 5x26x8,
        - but split() does it faster and easier
        - 
6.11/ python tunti
  - mostly doing the course work 
    - reason is because I have problem of organizing my files
    - unable to make the mooc work as I want it to

7.11/ python tunti
  - tunnilla list comprehension
  - set up works 
  - github working 
  - from now on will shift to uv-astral
  - still very impatient and arrogant 
    - when in task it was necessary to find way around function that did return None but 
    - printed value I arrogantly assumed that I know all and solution was simple looping
    - HOME
    - next is tmc
      - I made the line task too well and now I really dont need to do almost anything to pass the tasks.
      - enjoyed learning 

8.11/ home 60 min
  - finally back at payrollsystem task
    - honestly I can solve it but am investing in my future by learning to do it systematically
  - good progress 

9.11/ home 60 min
  - have an problem with the code my understanding of the class structure is lacking

10.11/ etä
  - tänään oli työelämässä oppiminen tunti 
    - Sain paljon uutta ajateltavaa ja selkeytin itselleni mihin hakeudun 
      - minulle myös selvisi lyhyen tähtäimen kiinnostuksen kohteet
    - sain myös tehtävän tehtyä
  - am unable to figure out this
    - number starts from 1 goes to 3 then  5 and keeps growing 2
  - solved it 
  - x+x+1


11.11/ 
  - did not do the journal in the home

12.11/ atea päivä
  - kerkesin ohjelmoimaan vähän ja ratkaisin aoc tehtävän
  - ja huomasin että tarvitsen problem managment systemin se ei ole sama kuin problem solving managment
    - se auttaisi minua jotta tunnistaisin ongelmat nopeamming enkä jäisi oman ajattelun loopiin

13.11/ linux tunti 1
  - now I can say 'btw I use arch linux'
  - its lot more fun than ubuntu as an idea I might take the plan of playing with nixos from the thought to action sooner


14.11/ linux tunti2
  - linux2 tunti 
    - learned about importance of taking snapshots when it comes to linux
    - most of it is similar to ubuntu just few feature difference
    -
