JOURNAL NOVEMBER

1.11/ 60 min
    - got distracted by waqaf
      - excited by the idea.
    - back to programming 
    - organized the project management 
    - pushed to github

2.11/ 60 min
    - feeling bit incoreherent 
    - not sure how to proceed
      - should I apply the playbook for deep practice playbook
        - deep practice 
    - am doing the payrollsystem from metropolia

3.11/ dayly schedule
    - had problem with grid problem 
      - knew intuitively that my solution was inefficient
        - reason I could not find better solution is because I have not met grid problems before

4.11/ dayly schedule
    - went to tech event in today very exciting but also tiring mind is still processing things I learned.
    - next figuring out if I can learn some how grid or other patterns 
      - probably same approach as learning chess patterns get them in conseptually and it will get easier 
      - learn to observe my internal solution pattern
        - Task 7: Running Total
          - Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Output: [1, 3, 6, 10]
          - Ask: "How does each element relate to previous ones?"
      - I think this 
        - 1 +2
        - 2+4 
        - the issue is no thought is full they are fragmented
        - starts stops in flash of moment realises that solution wont work and stops without going to the point where right solution could be found
    - focus on learning patterns and figuring out how they grow to algorithms
