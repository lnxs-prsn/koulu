  - learned about dataclasses
    - they make class making faster
    - but its rigid
home
  - the book I thought of reading might not be best for this course as 
    - the examples are in c++ and am learning python 
    - what book teaches is what I need but wrapping my head over different language to 
    - learn programming problem solving processes might not be worth it
  - next homework
    - did most of the task
    - am not sure if I understood the task correctly 
  - OVER ALL
    - I have began slipping on the discipline 
      - might need drill week to train the basics of self conduct


2.12/ home
  - finished the school task 
    - not sure if I did it correctly as I have never done this before
  - next is mooc
    - bit distracted 
      - I have said this few times now 
        - RETURN TO ADDRESS LATER
  - section of mooc done 1/4
    - most looks very easy but I will use time learning 'THINK BEFORE YOU CODE' 
      - I have found that programming is more enjoyable and faster when I think ahead
        - what are the requirements of the task 
        - what does it limit me from doing 
        - how much over engineering will I permit for myself
        - what architectural decision need to be made now so I avoid endless fix as you proceed 
          - then return to change something as something did not work out as intended
        - this allows me to see myself and my lackings better

  - today was ohjaus 
    - I fixed my misunderstandings so far 
    - rest of the day I have been doing mooc
      - now on I will focus on the design pattern recognition 
        - I found out that the coding part no matter how complex it might appear 
        - after the design phase takes max 15 min 
        - I have already by then made the design decision and am in flow mode 
        - so am more productive

  - great day after a while I was quite out of my comfort zone
    - I generally knew how I could do it as I imagined
      - but I could not grasp at all how the teacher intended to do 
      - and I still dont understand  
        - I will use AI to go through the game to understand what was the problem for me not understanding 
home 
  - It was an great moment I have finally reached step where I can get rid of my confusion about OOP 
  - got multiple exercises with AI and figured out why I succeed so well with functions but fail so miserably with objects 
    - I do not know arrow direction of the dependencies because the OOP logic is nigh opposite to real life arrows of depedencies between objects 

5.12/ self study day
  - got myself drills to cement my understanding about arrow direction patterns with OOP 
    - really enjoying today it feels great to get rid of ignorance.
    - will pull the exercises through the problem journal and store to new folder of concepts 
    - It seems bit more challenging than I thought to figure out the OOP design but I feel that I grasp more every time I try
  - passed on going to bitcoin event am feeling that by the end of the day I will have better understanding of the python if I keep at it
  - I am understanding the arrow flow of the objects relationships

6.12/ 60 min
  - the viope task was very easy I just misunderstood the exercise
  - dont know which day it is since I began 
  - am still curious and learning more 
    - my present challenges appear to be mostly reading comprehension as that appears to be my biggest time waste
      - I have succeeded cutting it down by adding 'did I understand it correctly' at the beginning of every task I start
    - other challenges are emptiness of my conceptual library 
      - OOP concepts are easy to comprehend but challenging to apply to this issue 
        -  or at least I assume this is the case.

7.12/ 60min
  - began bit slow the viope project
    - its simple but I might get suprises later on.
  - the book is good first 5 min helped me to coordinate my effort better in learning

  - will continue with the OOP 
    - I dont intuitively yet understand relationships objects have 
      - meaning I do not understand the priciple of object building 
        - which is coordinator object in cluster of object 
        - which is data object
  - went well drilled further my understanding  about 
    - OOP concepts 
    - knocked on the door of system design with the help of AI
  - progressed quite well
    - had to stop myself going too deep to system design 
      - my current scope is just learn OOP design principles and its logical flow of process
        - which is central node etc
  - day went pleasanty forgot few times to take break but else all good 
    - at somepoint had to take power nap as I had cooked the brains too much
  - 7 domain modeling templates I made now ensure almost 100% success when figuring out how data and authority flows in object programming
    - without them I default to my incorrect assumptions and reach 50% success rate
  - good day I yet have not programmed single line of code
    - I have focused on improving my conseptual undestanding 


9.12/
iopv
  - proceeded to design decisions of the OOP
    - I now understand better how I should have proceeded with the battleship game
      - also I understand better how relationships of he objects works who is in charge and who is merely participant
      - I might be over evaluating myself but I feel like I could now do jr dev tasks.
  - day went well I got to point of designing an whole project 


  10.12/

  - I know what is being taught but I dont know them enought to be able to explain to some one
    - so now I need to learn them well enough to explain them
  - lista työntekijöista ja heidän esihenkilö
    - TYONTEKIJÄ EMMO EMMONEN ESIHENKILÖ ESSI ESIHENKILÖ
      - had problem getting executable to work but finally resolved 


11.12/
gitpv1
  - refreshed git knowledge and delved deeper to branching.
home
  - will continue the OOP concepts
    - I misunderstood the OOP design principles now have been fixing the misunderstanding 
  

12.12/
sqlpv2
  - learned a lot 
    - mostly reviewed bits that I knew as syntax is mostly in the memory
  - asked teacher and school mate for an help related to the OOP principles 
    - I finally have some contex space to balance the gpt and the deepseek 
      - I mostly ran to figure out what the AI set but obviously AI gives 
      - theoretically how it should be but in practice it might not make sense at all.
  - I definitely on my oen need to study more about sql 
    - just presently very fixated on python.
home
  - succeeded doing the sudoku medium level as the book had recommended
    - I think I just need more exercise new few more challenges so I get to mindset the book wants me to get to
    - TOMMORROW OR DAY AFTER REVIEW PROGRESS SO FAR


13.12/ 60min
  - review:
    - located the problem 
      - lack of managerial layer in my activity
        - to be resolved as soon as possible latest before next year


14.12/ 60min 
  - fixing the computer had to use timeshift so I would not shoot myself on the foot
  - what are progressing well?  
    - the managment layer system should be readier sooner than I  thought 
  - what is laggin 
    - due to focusing on the python and sql I have not applied for training places 
      - this will be resolved next week latest as the managment system should be up and running 


15.12/ 
sqlpv3
  - trying to read about the managerial layer system 
    - soft goal would be to have it done by the end of this week 
      - means that skeleton system 
      - ready for simple use cases
      - some form of deadlines set for execution limit
  - unfocused day
home
  - phone call changed priorities of the day
    - now better focus on applying for an training position
  - another task is to set up the managerial layer.


16.12/

  - made video cv application 
    - its still not ready as I likely have to redo it as am not really satisfied with it.
home
  - from now on more meaningful git commenting 
    -   need to research how to do it in systematic manner
        -   goal would be to use most used system in the industry
  - next is to do the managerial layer setting
    - small worry that the python OOP principle section might have to redone
    - also I have to resolve the OS problem likely revert to last working settings or reinstalling whole system.

  - bit disorganized as the drive of what to improve was clear in the beginning 
    - now is bit unclear so this week I will keep drilling the OOP 
    - next week return to algorithm problems 
    - by the next week it would be good if I have template ready for the managerial layer no deadline pressures yet
      - there is 3 option:
        - Personal Management System (PMS)
          - whole system has everything 
            - its more complex to implement
            - once its implemented I might not need any other system ever again 
            - I would be able to manage work life balance with this lot easier 
            - now that I dont have any real work pressures it would be best investment on myself  
        - Task Evaluation & Control Template
          - more longterm but one project at a time 
            - with this I cannot decide easily which project should get my attention
        - Personal Agile Weekly Template
          - fastest and easiest to implement for my current exection layer
          - its not much of longterm 
            - and I might still have to do equal amount of work later or not 
  - will finish the first OOP project fully self designed
    - finished the OOP project
      - it failed as expected 
        - flaws in the design decision I made 
        - flaws in the object level implementation
      - next I will run debugging of my understanding 
        - debugging began 
          - setting up all the necessessary files and folders 
          - dont know if I will continue today or tomorrow 


18.12/
etäpv
  - will continue the mooc for the first half of the morning then return to the debuggin of the yesterday
  - mooc goal was achieved the blueprint is effective and am getting the pattern recognition % up
    - need to turn it formal way to measure my progress now its mostly emotion based 
  - did also the OOP principles blue print 
    - learned from my errors corrected my incorrect understanding of OOP principles 
      - now I have data flow clear tomorrow I will attempt to do new 3 object project further assessment of my direction
  - rest of the day I will evaluate my chosen managerial layer instinctively I am resistant 
    - but problem solving book that am reading says chose the simplest and easiest path and grow from there.
  - energies have been low lately might have to consider exercising to maintain the focus.


19.12/
etäpv
  - proceeding to do the mooc 
    - did few tasks 
  - continued with domain modeling problem directory 
    - I have learned by questioning the AI about what was wrong and confirmed my guesses about OOP principles
      - next goal is to do written learning about the mistakes without help from the AI


20.12/ 60min
  - viope day
    - finished the viope 1.6 exercise


21.12/ 60min
  - discipline is bit shaky needs to be reinforced in the monday and steadily maintained through out the week.
  - next is the viope chapeter 11 section 1.7
  - very slow progress 


22.12/
etäpv
  - starting day with mooc 
    - training the algoritmic problem solving with those tasks
    - figured out how to turn my specific solutions to abstractions that are applicable to all similar problems.
      - correct term might be solution genralization
  - next is  the domain modeling



23.12/
etäpv
  - yesterday I began using the PEMT template and I found out that what I assumed to be domain modeling 
    - was in reality it was hybrid of domain modeling (DDD) and OOP principles that I concoted 
      - from the explanation of the AI (problem with AI is that its really good hype man but bad coach if you are going wrong direction it tries to bend reality to fit your direction instead of correcting you) 
      - I will correct that today by setting up separate directories for
      - domain modeling and OOP
      - goal is to start with OOP principles and proceed with domain modeling
        - to get full understanding of what am I doing and why am I doing it 

  - day began with the algorithm problems folder task
    - finished yesterdays task
      - learned that I am having an monologue when solving task
      - instead I need to learn to have an dialogue with the computer 
        - I need to make it understand my intention its important that I understand my intention but its equally important the computer understands my intenttion
    - I have slight problem of stopping a task once I need to shift to new task
      - mind still keeps solving the previous task
      - figure out how to make shift easier.
  - next is the OOP and domain modeling
    - templates are ready for both

    - wasted full hour trying to  prove irrelevant law case viability with AI 
      - it was possible but would have needed strategist of highest level to succeed.
  - next is the algorim_problems folder
    - began new task 
      - mooc cp5 subch 3 task 1
        - solutions is easy but for some reason the patterns of the task
          - are almost as large as the logical operations 
            - will look it further later to understand further
  - next is the setting up the OOP directory
    - goal is simple questions template that walks me through how to mass produce OOP principles compliant projects
      - then review the solution I come up with the AI until I have 360 perspective to OOP and muscle memory of the process
      - I have now 2 simple OOP principle templates 
      - multiple full templates for more complex learning 



25.12/
etäpv
  - PEMT is ready
    - set up the pemt folder
    - bit waste as this is last week of the year but beginnings matter
  - next patterns recognition training 
    - mooc cp5 subch3 task2 from now on mooc 5.3.2 etc
    - I have reached a limit where I need to create an template to get grasp for understanding the pattern recognition
    - beyong reiterating the logical operations 
  - next is using the OOP template to see if it works
    - this template is bit more challenging than the previous hybrid domain modeling template
    - added bit more for the domain modeling 
  - day is finished 
    - it could have been more productive but its better than beginning of the week.

  - found in the system the jupyter I thought I had not installed it just went to some random location 
    - will resolve later
  - proceeding where left with the mooc 5.3.2
    - am grateful I finally solved one big problem in my programming 
      - I have lots of solution but they all go same direction 
      - from now on I have an way to diversify my solution path 
    - CAUTION!
      - achieved understanding is not presently compatiple with outlined goal of learning 
        - present goal is easier comprehesion of the problem understanding 
          - diversifying solution path leads to looking too long on one problem.
            - which in turn will slow the horizontal learning which is very important as of now
            - later I can focus on vertical depth.
  - next OOP 
    - good progress improved understanding about how object communicate 
      - essense is to enable the communication in the object level 
      - and then main() links the objects so there is never hardwired communication between objects
