  - learned about dataclasses
    - they make class making faster
    - but its rigid
home
  - the book I thought of reading might not be best for this course as 
    - the examples are in c++ and am learning python 
    - what book teaches is what I need but wrapping my head over different language to 
    - learn programming problem solving processes might not be worth it
  - next homework
    - did most of the task
    - am not sure if I understood the task correctly 
  - OVER ALL
    - I have began slipping on the discipline 
      - might need drill week to train the basics of self conduct


2.12/ home
  - finished the school task 
    - not sure if I did it correctly as I have never done this before
  - next is mooc
    - bit distracted 
      - I have said this few times now 
        - RETURN TO ADDRESS LATER
  - section of mooc done 1/4
    - most looks very easy but I will use time learning 'THINK BEFORE YOU CODE' 
      - I have found that programming is more enjoyable and faster when I think ahead
        - what are the requirements of the task 
        - what does it limit me from doing 
        - how much over engineering will I permit for myself
        - what architectural decision need to be made now so I avoid endless fix as you proceed 
          - then return to change something as something did not work out as intended
        - this allows me to see myself and my lackings better

  - today was ohjaus 
    - I fixed my misunderstandings so far 
    - rest of the day I have been doing mooc
      - now on I will focus on the design pattern recognition 
        - I found out that the coding part no matter how complex it might appear 
        - after the design phase takes max 15 min 
        - I have already by then made the design decision and am in flow mode 
        - so am more productive

  - great day after a while I was quite out of my comfort zone
    - I generally knew how I could do it as I imagined
      - but I could not grasp at all how the teacher intended to do 
      - and I still dont understand  
        - I will use AI to go through the game to understand what was the problem for me not understanding 
home 
  - It was an great moment I have finally reached step where I can get rid of my confusion about OOP 
  - got multiple exercises with AI and figured out why I succeed so well with functions but fail so miserably with objects 
    - I do not know arrow direction of the dependencies because the OOP logic is nigh opposite to real life arrows of depedencies between objects 

5.12/ self study day
  - got myself drills to cement my understanding about arrow direction patterns with OOP 
    - really enjoying today it feels great to get rid of ignorance.
    - will pull the exercises through the problem journal and store to new folder of concepts 
    - It seems bit more challenging than I thought to figure out the OOP design but I feel that I grasp more every time I try
  - passed on going to bitcoin event am feeling that by the end of the day I will have better understanding of the python if I keep at it
  - I am understanding the arrow flow of the objects relationships

6.12/ 60 min
  - the viope task was very easy I just misunderstood the exercise
  - dont know which day it is since I began 
  - am still curious and learning more 
    - my present challenges appear to be mostly reading comprehension as that appears to be my biggest time waste
      - I have succeeded cutting it down by adding 'did I understand it correctly' at the beginning of every task I start
    - other challenges are emptiness of my conceptual library 
      - OOP concepts are easy to comprehend but challenging to apply to this issue 
        -  or at least I assume this is the case.

7.12/ 60min
  - began bit slow the viope project
    - its simple but I might get suprises later on.
  - the book is good first 5 min helped me to coordinate my effort better in learning

  - will continue with the OOP 
    - I dont intuitively yet understand relationships objects have 
      - meaning I do not understand the priciple of object building 
        - which is coordinator object in cluster of object 
        - which is data object
  - went well drilled further my understanding  about 
    - OOP concepts 
    - knocked on the door of system design with the help of AI
  - progressed quite well
    - had to stop myself going too deep to system design 
      - my current scope is just learn OOP design principles and its logical flow of process
        - which is central node etc
  - day went pleasanty forgot few times to take break but else all good 
    - at somepoint had to take power nap as I had cooked the brains too much
  - 7 domain modeling templates I made now ensure almost 100% success when figuring out how data and authority flows in object programming
    - without them I default to my incorrect assumptions and reach 50% success rate
  - good day I yet have not programmed single line of code
    - I have focused on improving my conseptual undestanding 


9.12/
iopv
  - proceeded to design decisions of the OOP
    - I now understand better how I should have proceeded with the battleship game
      - also I understand better how relationships of he objects works who is in charge and who is merely participant
      - I might be over evaluating myself but I feel like I could now do jr dev tasks.
  - day went well I got to point of designing an whole project

  - I know what is being taught but I dont know them enought to be able to explain to some one
    - so now I need to learn them well enough to explain them
  - lista työntekijöista ja heidän esihenkilö
    - TYONTEKIJÄ EMMO EMMONEN ESIHENKILÖ ESSI ESIHENKILÖ
      - had problem getting executable to work but finally resolved 


11.12/
gitpv1
  - refreshed git knowledge and delved deeper to branching.
home
  - will continue the OOP concepts
    - I misunderstood the OOP design principles now have been fixing the misunderstanding 
  

12.12/
sqlpv2
  - learned a lot 
    - mostly reviewed bits that I knew as syntax is mostly in the memory
  - asked teacher and school mate for an help related to the OOP principles 
    - I finally have some contex space to balance the gpt and the deepseek 
      - I mostly ran to figure out what the AI set but obviously AI gives 
      - theoretically how it should be but in practice it might not make sense at all.
  - I definitely on my oen need to study more about sql 
    - just presently very fixated on python.
home
  - succeeded doing the sudoku medium level as the book had recommended
    - I think I just need more exercise new few more challenges so I get to mindset the book wants me to get to
    - TOMMORROW OR DAY AFTER REVIEW PROGRESS SO FAR


13.12/ 60min
  - review:
    - located the problem 
      - lack of managerial layer in my activity
        - to be resolved as soon as possible latest before next year


14.12/ 60min 
  - fixing the computer had to use timeshift so I would not shoot myself on the foot
  - what are progressing well?  
    - the managment layer system should be readier sooner than I  thought 
  - what is laggin 
    - due to focusing on the python and sql I have not applied for training places 
      - this will be resolved next week latest as the managment system should be up and running 


15.12/

  - trying to read about the managerial layer system 
    - soft goal would be to have it done by the end of this week 
      - means that skeleton system 
      - ready for simple use cases
      - some form of deadlines set for execution limit
  - unfocused day
home
  - phone call changed priorities of the day
    - now better focus on applying for an training position
  - another task is to set up the managerial layer.

  - made video cv application 
    - its still not ready as I likely have to redo it as am not really satisfied with it.
home
  - from now on more meaningful git commenting 
    -   need to research how to do it in systematic manner
        -   goal would be to use most used system in the industry
  - next is to do the managerial layer setting
    - small worry that the python OOP principle section might have to redone
    - also I have to resolve the OS problem likely revert to last working settings or reinstalling whole system.

  - bit disorganized as the drive of what to improve was clear in the beginning 
    - now is bit unclear so this week I will keep drilling the OOP 
    - next week return to algorithm problems 
    - by the next week it would be good if I have template ready for the managerial layer no deadline pressures yet
      - there is 3 option:
        - Personal Management System (PMS)
          - whole system has everything 
            - its more complex to implement
            - once its implemented I might not need any other system ever again 
            - I would be able to manage work life balance with this lot easier 
            - now that I dont have any real work pressures it would be best investment on myself  
        - Task Evaluation & Control Template
          - more longterm but one project at a time 
            - with this I cannot decide easily which project should get my attention
        - Personal Agile Weekly Template
          - fastest and easiest to implement for my current exection layer
          - its not much of longterm 
            - and I might still have to do equal amount of work later or not 
  - will finish the first OOP project fully self designed
    - finished the OOP project
      - it failed as expected 
        - flaws in the design decision I made 
        - flaws in the object level implementation
      - next I will run debugging of my understanding 
        - debugging began 
          - setting up all the necessessary files and folders 
          - dont know if I will continue today or tomorrow

  - will continue the mooc for the first half of the morning then return to the debuggin of the yesterday
