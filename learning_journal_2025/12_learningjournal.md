  - learned about dataclasses
    - they make class making faster
    - but its rigid
home
  - the book I thought of reading might not be best for this course as 
    - the examples are in c++ and am learning python 
    - what book teaches is what I need but wrapping my head over different language to 
    - learn programming problem solving processes might not be worth it
  - next homework
    - did most of the task
    - am not sure if I understood the task correctly 
  - OVER ALL
    - I have began slipping on the discipline 
      - might need drill week to train the basics of self conduct


2.12/ home
  - finished the school task 
    - not sure if I did it correctly as I have never done this before
  - next is mooc
    - bit distracted 
      - I have said this few times now 
        - RETURN TO ADDRESS LATER
  - section of mooc done 1/4
    - most looks very easy but I will use time learning 'THINK BEFORE YOU CODE' 
      - I have found that programming is more enjoyable and faster when I think ahead
        - what are the requirements of the task 
        - what does it limit me from doing 
        - how much over engineering will I permit for myself
        - what architectural decision need to be made now so I avoid endless fix as you proceed 
          - then return to change something as something did not work out as intended
        - this allows me to see myself and my lackings better

  - today was ohjaus 
    - I fixed my misunderstandings so far 
    - rest of the day I have been doing mooc
      - now on I will focus on the design pattern recognition 
        - I found out that the coding part no matter how complex it might appear 
        - after the design phase takes max 15 min 
        - I have already by then made the design decision and am in flow mode 
        - so am more productive

  - great day after a while I was quite out of my comfort zone
    - I generally knew how I could do it as I imagined
      - but I could not grasp at all how the teacher intended to do 
      - and I still dont understand  
        - I will use AI to go through the game to understand what was the problem for me not understanding 
home 
  - It was an great moment I have finally reached step where I can get rid of my confusion about OOP 
  - got multiple exercises with AI and figured out why I succeed so well with functions but fail so miserably with objects 
    - I do not know arrow direction of the dependencies because the OOP logic is nigh opposite to real life arrows of depedencies between objects 

5.12/ self study day
  - got myself drills to cement my understanding about arrow direction patterns with OOP 
    - really enjoying today it feels great to get rid of ignorance.
    - will pull the exercises through the problem journal and store to new folder of concepts 
    - It seems bit more challenging than I thought to figure out the OOP design but I feel that I grasp more every time I try
  - passed on going to bitcoin event am feeling that by the end of the day I will have better understanding of the python if I keep at it
  - I am understanding the arrow flow of the objects relationships

6.12/ 60 min
  - the viope task was very easy I just misunderstood the exercise
  - dont know which day it is since I began 
  - am still curious and learning more 
    - my present challenges appear to be mostly reading comprehension as that appears to be my biggest time waste
      - I have succeeded cutting it down by adding 'did I understand it correctly' at the beginning of every task I start
    - other challenges are emptiness of my conceptual library 
      - OOP concepts are easy to comprehend but challenging to apply to this issue 
        -  or at least I assume this is the case.

7.12/ 60min
  - began bit slow the viope project
    - its simple but I might get suprises later on.
  - the book is good first 5 min helped me to coordinate my effort better in learning

  - will continue with the OOP 
    - I dont intuitively yet understand relationships objects have 
      - meaning I do not understand the priciple of object building 
        - which is coordinator object in cluster of object 
        - which is data object
  - went well drilled further my understanding  about 
    - OOP concepts 
    - knocked on the door of system design with the help of AI
  - progressed quite well
    - had to stop myself going too deep to system design 
      - my current scope is just learn OOP design principles and its logical flow of process
        - which is central node etc
  - day went pleasanty forgot few times to take break but else all good 
    - at somepoint had to take power nap as I had cooked the brains too much
  - 7 domain modeling templates I made now ensure almost 100% success when figuring out how data and authority flows in object programming
    - without them I default to my incorrect assumptions and reach 50% success rate
  - good day I yet have not programmed single line of code
    - I have focused on improving my conseptual undestanding 


9.12/
iopv
  - proceeded to design decisions of the OOP
    - I now understand better how I should have proceeded with the battleship game
      - also I understand better how relationships of he objects works who is in charge and who is merely participant
      - I might be over evaluating myself but I feel like I could now do jr dev tasks.
  - day went well I got to point of designing an whole project

  - I know what is being taught but I dont know them enought to be able to explain to some one
    - so now I need to learn them well enough to explain them
