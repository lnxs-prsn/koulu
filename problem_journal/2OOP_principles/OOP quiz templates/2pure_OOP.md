I want provide me more quizes like this one below 

Question 1

Read the task:

"Design a simple system for a library. There is a base LibraryItem class with common properties like title, author, and id. We need specific types for Book (has numPages) and DVD (has durationMinutes). All item types must have a getDescription() method, but the format of the description differs per type."

Which combination of OOP principles is the primary foundation for this design?

A) Encapsulation + Abstraction → Data hiding is used, and complex reality is reduced to essential features.
B) Inheritance + Polymorphism → A hierarchy is established to share common code, while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations.
C) Composition + Abstraction → Objects are built from others, and a simplified interface is presented.
D) Polymorphism + Encapsulation → Methods behave differently based on the object, and internal state is protected.
E) I don’t know.
