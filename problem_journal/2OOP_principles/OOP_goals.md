Master the 4 pillars as your foundation—they define OOP.

Use composition heavily—it’s safer and more flexible than deep inheritance (especially in Python).

Gradually layer in SOLID as you design larger systems (e.g., your library or bank app).

Don’t get hung up on labels—focus on what each idea helps you achieve:
Encapsulation → protect integrity
Abstraction → reduce cognitive load
Polymorphism → enable extensibility
Composition → build flexible systems
