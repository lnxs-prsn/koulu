1. Do any steps repeat?
(Not "is there a loop?" but: what decision or action happens the same way for each item?)
2. Do some steps always happen together?
(If this group had a job title, what would it be? Example: "filter matches" not "loop → if → append")
3. Is there an "if this, then that" part that shows up often?
(What question is being asked each time? Example: "is this better than current best?" not "if statement exists")
4. Does the process go: Step A → Step B → Step C… and then start over with new info?
(What changes each cycle? What stays the same? Example: item changes; the test stays identical)
5. Are you doing the same kind of thing to different items?
(Would your description still work if you swapped "movies" for "products"?)
6. Can you describe a group of steps in one short sentence?
(Does your sentence use general actions ("keep items matching…") not specific things ("match word to movies")?)
7. If you covered up the details, would the shape of the process look familiar?
(What are the 3 core verbs? Example: "scan → test → collect" not "access → search → append")
