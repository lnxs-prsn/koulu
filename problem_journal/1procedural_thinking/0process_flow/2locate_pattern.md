TRY TO LEARN CORRECT PATTERN TERMINOLOGY
    -   long term goal no rush!

CORE OF PATTERN RECOGNITION
    -   The habit of interrogating MY own examples for invariant structure.
    -   An invariant is something that stays the same across all cases 
        -    the unchanging core beneath surface differences.
   -    "why this and not that? is there something forcing it to be this way?"



1. Do any steps repeat?
(Exactly the same? Or almost the same with just a small change?)
2. Do some steps always happen together?
(Like: “check something → do something → record result” — does that trio show up more than once?)
3. Is there a “if this, then that” part that shows up often?
(Same kind of choice happening in different places?)
4. Does the process go: Step A → Step B → Step C… and then start over with new info?
(Like a cycle or loop?)
5. Are you doing the same kind of thing to different items?
(For example: “look at voter 1 → count vote → save. Then look at voter 2 → count vote → save…”)
6. Can you describe a group of steps in one short sentence?
(If yes, that’s probably a pattern or a chunk you can reuse.)
7. If you covered up the details, would the shape of the process look familiar?
(Like: “check → act → move on” or “gather → decide → respond”)
