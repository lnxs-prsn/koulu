Virtually every correct solution to a programming problem can be generalized—because programming is the act of writing general instructions that work for many inputs, not just one.

But let’s clarify what “generalized” really means, because that’s where the nuance lies.

✅ What "Generalization" Actually Means in Programming
It does not mean:

“Every single line must use abstract symbols like i and j.”
“You must solve all possible problems at once.”
It does mean:

Identify what’s fixed in your example vs. what varies—and write code that works for any valid value of the varying parts.

So even if a problem seems “specific,” there’s almost always a general pattern underneath.


 The Only Exceptions (Rare)
Generalization doesn’t apply only when:

The task is truly one-off with no pattern (e.g., “Draw this exact pixel art of a cat”).
You’re writing configuration or test data, not logic.
But in algorithmic programming—especially tasks like transpose, sorting, searching, traversing—generalization is the goal.
