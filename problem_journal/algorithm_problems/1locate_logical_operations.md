list logical opeations 1 by 1
    -   what needs to be initiated
    -   what it stores 
    -   how to find what it stores 
    -   does it need if stament or a loop
    -   etc
-   

what are the minimal operations that I need to do to solve the task
    -   example transposition matrix task 
        -   i need to only visit these location in the matrix:
            -   (0,1),(0,2),(1,2) so how can I ignore other positions 
                -   for j in range(i + 1, n)  n = all the positions I need to visit i is outer loop j is inner loop
can comparison be built or expressed other ways? than just x > y

GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS PATTERS CAN ONLY BE SEEN IF WHOLE PROCESS IS LOOKED AT
    !!! DO NOT BE LAZY IN THIS STAGE! THIS STAGE CONTROLS YOUR LEARNING SPEED IF YOU JUMP OVER STEPS 
    !!! YOU WILL HAVE TO COME BACK TO THEM LATER ONE WAY OR OTHER!

to get elegan solution ask:
    -   what, how, when
    -   what implementation constraints arise from solution
        -   if solution is just two moves then implementation constraint is 
            -   how can I do it with just two moves.
    -   when should action occur?

AM I THINKING ONLY 
    -   procedurally rather than structurally.
    -   Use procedural thinking to understand the concrete steps (your strength).
    -   Use structural thinking to organize those steps so they can’t go wrong (the refinement you just learned).
    -   Concrete examples → reveal patterns → which inform structure → which guarantees correctness.   

AM I HAVING AN MONOLOGUE OR AM HAVING A DIALOG WITH THE COMPUTER
    -   computer doesn’t care about my intent. It only executes exactly what I say, in the order I say it.
    -   so am I having an monologue where only I know the intent or am I having an dialogue where computer also knows the intent
    -
