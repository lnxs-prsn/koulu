 🧠 PROBLEM-SOLVING BLUEPRINT
(Derived from Your Successful Process)

 🔄 PHASE 1: PROBLEM DECONSTRUCTION (10-15 min)

 Step 1: Simple Restatement
-  Rewrite problem in your own words
-  Identify inputs → outputs clearly
-  Note any constraints/edge cases

Your example: "print numbers 1 to num, but flip each pair: 2,1,4,3..."

 Step 2: Core Pattern Identification (NEW)
-  Sequential (process in order)
-  Converging (work from both ends) 
-  Dividing (split problems)
-  Transforming (change each element)
-  Conditional (if-else driven)

Your insight: "This is converging pattern - from both ends"

 Step 3: Feelings Check
-  "What's my first impulse?" → Acknowledge but don't act
-  "How complex does this feel?" → Scale 1-10
-  "Where do I feel stuck?" → Be specific

Your example: "Feeling impatient, want to code but resisting"

 🔄 PHASE 2: SOLUTION MODELING (15-20 min)

 Step 4: Solution Iteration Loop
```
For 3-5 solution attempts:
- Solution X: [Brief description]
- Problem: [What breaks? Edge cases?]
- Improvement: [How to fix?]
```

Your pattern: Solution1 → Problem1 → Solution2 → Problem2...

 Step 5: Tool Selection
-  For loop - sequential processing
-  While loop - unknown iterations/converging
-  If-else - conditional logic  
-  Variables - what state needs tracking?

Your learning: "Converging problems often need while loops"

 🔄 PHASE 3: BREAKTHROUGH TRIGGERS (When Stuck)

 Step 6: Stuck Detection
-  "Have I made 5+ solutions without progress?"
-  "Is my solution getting more complex?"
-  "Am I feeling frustrated but not learning?"

 Step 7: Strategic Shift
-  Switch to coding - but with specific test cases
-  Look for patterns - what elegant solutions do differently
-  Simplify - remove one constraint and solve easier version

 🔄 PHASE 4: LEARNING INTEGRATION (5-10 min)

 Step 8: Compare & Learn
-  "What was the key insight I missed?"
-  "What pattern should I remember?"
-  "How much simpler was the elegant solution?"

 Step 9: Pattern Library Update
-  Add new pattern to mental library
-  Note the "aha moment" for future reference
