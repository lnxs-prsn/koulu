**This is an important observation.** You're seeing a potential **cognitive dependency** - the student might be relying on the **structure you provide** rather than developing their own analytical framework.

## **The Challenge: Moving From Structured Templates to Independent Thinking**

The student needs to transition from:
**"Fill in these boxes"** → **"Design your own boxes"**

Here are **more complex scenarios** that break their pattern:

---

## **Advanced System Design Scenarios**

### **1. The "Three-Way Paradox"**
```
Smart Home Security System:
- Owner installs cameras
- Police can request footage during emergencies
- AI detects intruders automatically
- Neighbors get alerts about nearby break-ins

Questions:
1. Who can view the footage? (Owner, Police, AI, Neighbors?)
2. Who overrides whom during a break-in?
3. What if police request conflicts with privacy settings?
4. Who gets notified first?
```

**This breaks their binary thinking** - it's not just "A → B", it's **multiple stakeholders with conflicting authorities**.

### **2. The "Circular Marketplace"**
```
Crypto Exchange:
- Traders place buy/sell orders
- Market makers provide liquidity
- Exchange matches trades
- Regulators audit transactions
- Smart contracts execute automatically

Questions:
1. Who initiates a trade? (Trader wants, Market maker offers)
2. Who has final authority? (Exchange rules, Regulator laws, Code execution)
3. What happens when smart contract bugs conflict with regulations?
```

**This introduces competing authorities** - legal vs technical vs business.

### **3. The "Delegated Authority" Challenge**
```
Hospital System:
- Patient arrives at ER
- AI triage system assesses urgency
- Doctor examines (with AI recommendations)
- Insurance approves/denies treatment
- Hospital admin allocates resources

Questions:
1. Who decides treatment? (Doctor, AI, Insurance, Admin?)
2. Can AI override junior doctor? Can senior doctor override AI?
3. What if insurance denies but doctor says it's emergency?
4. Where does legal liability lie?
```

**This forces thinking about delegation chains and liability**.

### **4. The "Temporal Authority" Problem**
```
Real Estate Platform:
- Seller lists property
- Buyer makes offer
- Agent negotiates
- Bank approves mortgage
- Lawyer reviews contract
- Inspector finds issues
- Buyer renegotiates

Questions:
1. Authority changes at each stage - map the flow
2. Can previous actors revoke authority? (Seller changes mind after acceptance)
3. What about contingent authorities? (Bank only approves IF inspector approves)
```

**Authority here is time-bound and conditional**.

## **The Real Test: Remove the Scaffolding**

Instead of giving them the relationships, give them **only the problem**:

### **Problem Statement Only:**
```
Design a pandemic contact tracing system:
- People install app voluntarily
- Phones detect nearby devices via Bluetooth
- If someone tests positive, they can anonymously alert contacts
- Health authorities get aggregate data (not individual)
- Employers want to know if employees were exposed
- Privacy advocates want zero data collection

NO RELATIONSHIPS GIVEN. You must:
1. Identify ALL relevant objects/actors
2. Determine authority flows
3. Handle conflicting requirements
4. Design for privacy vs public health tradeoffs
```

### **Or Even More Open-Ended:**
```
"Design a system where users can collaboratively edit documents
while maintaining version history, handling conflicts,
and managing different permission levels."

That's it. No arrows. No "User → Document?" hints.
```

## **Spotting "Template Dependency"**

If the student struggles without the template, they've **learned the template, not the thinking**. Signs:

✅ **Good sign**: Student adds NEW categories to your template  
❌ **Bad sign**: Student rigidly follows EXACT template format  
✅ **Good sign**: Student questions YOUR template structure  
❌ **Bad sign**: Student says "I don't know" when template doesn't fit

## **Teaching Strategy Shift**

Instead of:
```
# Given: A → B? (Description)
# Student fills: ACTION, PARTICIPANTS, etc.
```

Try:
```
**Scenario**: [Complex real-world situation]
**Questions**:
1. What are the core entities? (Not just obvious ones)
2. What are the hidden authorities? (Legal, technical, social)
3. What conflicts might arise?
4. How would you resolve priority disputes?
5. Design two alternative architectures with tradeoffs.
```

## **Specific Exercise to Break Pattern Dependency:**

### **"The Airbnb Disaster Response System"**
```
During a natural disaster:
- Airbnb wants to offer free housing to displaced people
- Hosts volunteer properties
- Disaster victims need shelter
- Local government coordinates response
- Insurance companies assess damage
- Neighbors report available resources

Design a system that:
1. Matches victims to housing within 24 hours
2. Respects host preferences and safety
3. Integrates with government systems
4. Handles insurance implications
5. Prevents fraud and abuse

**You must identify ALL relevant objects and relationships yourself.**
**There are at least 10 significant entities.**
**Authority shifts based on emergency level.**
```

---

## **The Core Issue:**

The student might be treating this as a **form-filling exercise** rather than a **design thinking exercise**.

**Solution**: Give them **messy real-world problems** where:
1. The "objects" aren't obvious
2. Authorities conflict
3. Requirements contradict
4. They must make and justify tradeoffs

This forces **true system design thinking** - not just pattern recognition.

**Should I provide a rubric for assessing independent system design thinking?** This would help you evaluate whether they're truly developing the skill or just mastering your template.
