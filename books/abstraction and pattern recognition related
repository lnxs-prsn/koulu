"How to Design Programs" (HtDP)	Felleisen et al.	Systematic design recipe from concrete examples to templates.	Core match. Focuses on moving from concrete examples to general abstractions.

"The Little Schemer"	Friedman & Felleisen	Teaches recursive thinking and pattern recognition in a question-answer style.	Strong match. It trains pattern recognition, which is the foundation of generalization.

"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP)	Abelson & Sussman	Focuses on the essence of computational processes and building abstraction layers.	Strong match. Emphasizes extracting invariants and building abstractions from examples.

"Algorithmic Thinking" (2nd Ed.)	Daniel Zingaro	Teaches how to approach and deconstruct complex problems using algorithms.	Related but different. Focuses on algorithmic problem-solving, not the core skill of abstraction.

"Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS)	Cormen et al.	Comprehensive reference for classic algorithms and data structures.	Mismatch. A definitive reference, not a book for learning the process of generalization.

"Grokking Algorithms"	Aditya Bhargava	Beginner-friendly introduction to common algorithms with illustrations.	Mismatch. An intuitive primer on algorithms, not abstraction training.
